instant Pot Beans


My favorite bean recipe.


Ingredients:

Instant Pot Duo Plus

Strainer

Glossy bamboo spatula

Plastic holed spoon

Rinse beans {1 cup of beans: pinto or black || a beautiful medley of both bean varieties} in Instant Pot inner steel pot, once; soak around 6 hours. Drain in strainer and leave in strainer.
Fill instant pot with 4 cups of cold filtered water. Add 2.5 tbsp Bragg ACV, 1 tsp Morton Coarse Kosher salt, 1/6 tsp Morton Natural Sea Salt, 
1 tsp whole black peppercorns (Kirkland works). Wait 3 minutes between finishing at least 30 second thorough stir process with spatula (in part to avoid
scratching metal of pot, also because it's effective/efficient), and adding next ingredient. Add beans. Set instant pot to 45 minutes, all default but not
"keep warm". Natural release to full pressure equilibration.
