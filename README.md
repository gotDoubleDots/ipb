instant Pot Beans


My favorite bean recipe. Green lentil recipe at end.

Bean recipe pairs like a pear with creamy peanut butter.

Ingredients:

Instant Pot Duo Plus

Strainer

Glossy bamboo spatula

Plastic holed spoon

Rinse beans {1 cup of beans: pinto or black || a beautiful medley of both bean varieties} in Instant Pot inner steel pot by leaving in half full pot 30 minutes, once (place in pot of water, wait 30 sec, stir 30 sec w/ spatula, wait 30 mins & repeat stir process at end of 30 mins). Next, drain in strainer, replace water, and soak around 6 hours (same place and stir procedure). Next, again drain in strainer and leave beans there.

Fill instant pot with 4 cups of cold filtered water. Add 2.5 tbsp Bragg ACV, 1 tsp Morton Coarse Kosher salt, 1/6 tsp Morton Natural Sea Salt, 
1 tsp whole black peppercorns (Kirkland works). 

Each ingredient goes in separately; wait 30 seconds after adding ingredient to stir, stir 30 seconds, wait 3 minutes between finishing thorough stir process with spatula, and adding next ingredient. 

Add beans. Allow 30 second sit, stir seconds, then wait 3 minutes before setting inner pot within home Instant Pot. Set instant pot to 45 minutes, all default but not
"keep warm". Natural release to full pressure equilibration. Open 2-5 minutes after equilibrium.

### Green Lentil Variant

15 min soak (1/3 full instant pot); 8 min cook & same instant pot settings

switch water between soak and cook

1.75 cup water : 1 cup lentil (make 1 cup of lentils at once)

Flavoring proportioned from bean recipe to lentils by water volume 

These go well with honey and/or Greek Yogurt
